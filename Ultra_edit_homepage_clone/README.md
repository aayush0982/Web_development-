### UltraEdit Homepage Clone - Web Development Practice

This UltraEdit clone was created during my web development practice. As a UI/UX designer, I made a few improvements based on my current skill level:

1. **Redesigned the Navbar**: The logo and headings were centered, which didn't look appealing. I redesigned the navbar to improve the layout and visual balance.

2. **Adjusted Card Layout**: Increased the width and height of the cards and added the current version indicator, which was positioned as a line above the cards. This adjustment improved the UI and alignment.

3. **Footer Redesign**: Removed the extra "Subscribe to Newsletter" section, as it was already mentioned earlier on the page. I also repositioned the logo and social icons for a cleaner look.
