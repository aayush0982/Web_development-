# Cloning and Improvement in Netflix Design


### 1. Feature Section
- Netflix used gradient backgrounds for each card with inconsistent color palettes.
- Icons in two cards did not match the content and had colors that clashed with the gradients, resulting in a disjointed design.

### 2. FAQ Section
- The boxes in Netflix's FAQ section had unusual heights.
- Plus icons were much larger than the accompanying text, creating a visually unbalanced layout.

### 3. Email Entry Section
- Netflix's email entry section lacked proper alignment.
- The email input box and CTA button were overly large, breaking the visual consistency.

### 4. Footer Section
- Netflix did not include clear headings and subheadings in the footer.
- This made it challenging for users to navigate and locate items of interest.
